    <div class="ibox"><h3>The History of Carrom</h3>
        <p>Carrom is a popular tabletop game that originated in India over 100 years ago. It is believed to have been inspired by a similar game called Billiards, which was played by British officers stationed in India during the 19th century. The game of Carrom was first introduced to the world in the early 20th century and quickly gained popularity in South Asia, particularly in India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.</p>
        <p>The game is played on a wooden board with four pockets in the corners and a queen in the center. Players use a striker and small discs called carrom men to hit the other player's carrom men into the pockets and the queen into the center pocket. The game requires skill, precision, and strategy, and is enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels.</p>
    </div>
        <div class="ibox"><h3>The Rules of Carrom</h3>
        <p>To play Carrom, two to four players sit around the board and take turns hitting their carrom men with the striker. The player with the white carrom men goes first. The objective of the game is to pocket all of your carrom men and the queen before your opponent does.</p>
        <p>To start the game, the queen is placed in the center of the board and the carrom men are arranged in a specific pattern on either side of the board. Players take turns hitting their carrom men with the striker, attempting to pocket them in one of the four corner pockets. If a player pockets a carrom man, they get to take another turn. If they pocket the queen before all of their carrom men, they have to return the queen to the center of the board and forfeit their turn.</p> 
        <p>There are several rules and fouls that players must follow in Carrom. For example, players must strike their carrom men with the striker using only one hand and cannot touch the striker with any part of their body. If a player commits a foul, their opponent gets to place the striker anywhere on the board and take their turn.</p>

        <div class="ibox"><h3>Tips and Strategies for Winning at Carrom</h3>
        <p>To become a skilled Carrom player, it is important to practice regularly and develop good techniques and strategies. Here are some tips that can help you improve your game:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Focus on accuracy: In Carrom, precision is key. Practice hitting your carrom men with the striker at the right angle and speed to pocket them in the corners.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Control the striker: The striker is an important part of the game, and you should learn to control it well. Practice hitting your carrom men with the striker using different techniques, such as the flick, the push, and the follow-through.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Plan your shots: Before you hit your carrom men, think about where you want them to go and how you can set up your next shot. Try to create opportunities to pocket multiple carrom men with one shot.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Watch your opponent: Pay attention to your opponent's moves and try to anticipate their next move. Look for opportunities to block their shots or pocket their carrom men.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Stay calm and focused: Carrom can be a fast-paced and intense game, but it is important to stay calm and focused. Take deep breaths, stay relaxed, and stay focused on the game.</p>
