		<h1>About this Site and Its Creator</h1>

		<p> My name is Dev Patel and I'm from Gujarat, India. I've always been fascinated by technology and programming, which is why I decided to pursue my dreams by studying Computer Programming and Analysis at Seneca College in Toronto, Canada. As a student, I'm dedicated and hardworking, and I'm always eager to learn new concepts and explore new ideas in the field of technology.
            In my free time, I enjoy playing and watching sports, particularly cricket and soccer. I'm also a big fan of music and enjoy playing guitar and listening to a variety of genres. I'm an outgoing and friendly person who enjoys meeting new people and exploring new cultures. I arrived in Canada last year and have adapted well to life in this new country.
            
            I chose to create a website about the game of Carrom because of my love for the game and its popularity in India. </p>
        </div>
            <div class="box"><h2>Reason</h2>
	<p class="box">I chose to create this favorite game site about the game of Carrom because it is a popular and enjoyable game in my Home country. I wanted to share some experience, joy, pleasure and resources about playing game with you guys.</p>
