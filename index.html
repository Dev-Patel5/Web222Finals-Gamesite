   <div class="hbox"><p> Carrom is a popular board game played in India, which involves flicking small disks into pockets using a striker. The game is usually played with two or four players, and the goal is to score points by pocketing your own disks while preventing your opponent from pocketing theirs.

    To set up the game, a square board with four pockets in the corners is placed on a table or other flat surface. Each player takes turns using a striker to flick their disks into the pockets. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.</p></div>
    
    <div class="hbox"><p>As a kid growing up in India, I used to play carom with my friends Krush, Aditya, and Pratik. We would spend hours playing the game, trying to improve our skills and beat each other. We would gather around the board, taking turns flicking our disks and trying to pocket them as accurately as possible. It was always a lot of fun, and we would get really competitive, cheering each other on when we made a good shot and teasing each other when we missed.
    
        I remember one time when we were playing carom, and Aditya managed to sink all of his disks in one turn. We were all amazed and a little bit jealous of his skill. We spent the rest of the game trying to catch up to him, but he was just too good.
        
        To be successful in carom, it's important to practice your flicking technique and aim. You also need to be strategic in your shots, trying to block your opponent's disks while also setting up your own for easy pockets. One trick we used to use was to aim for the corners, where the pockets are more open and easier to hit.
        
        Even though I've moved to Canada now, I still play carom with my roommates from time to time. It's a great way to connect with my Indian heritage and relive some of the fun memories from my childhood. Plus, it's always a fun and challenging game to play, no matter where you are in the world.
